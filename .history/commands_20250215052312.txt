It's tricky to give you completely accurate lists for all these leagues right now. Team lineups can change due to promotions, relegations, and transfers, and the final makeup of each league for the next season might not be fully set yet.

However, I can give you a very good idea of the teams that are likely to be in each league, based on the current standings and recent seasons. Here are the lists, with the caveat that there might be a few small changes by the time the new season kicks off:
